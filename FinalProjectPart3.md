### Final Data Story 

#### Intended Audience
The intended audience for this story is people who have never really explored or seen an opera. BEcause I talk about industyr statistics as a whole, they are not stuck in any particular geographic region. I wanted this to be as broad as possible, which made getting specific data a bit difficult in the beginning. With this audience in mind, I aimed to avoid jargon and use language that an audience unfamiliar with opera would understand. I also tried to pick visuals that would be exciting and interesting for people who may otherwise not care about the art form. 

Because of my personal interests in opera and the arts, it was difficult to find people to interview who mimicked my target audience. However, I got a lot of valuable feedback from in-class critique. Orginally I had a visualization showing the names of different operas as the "hook" of my presentation. My classmates said that it just looked like a bunch of names and really didn't tell them anything about the art form. That was very helpful. To address this, I made that visualization less prominent and added a bit more narrative explanation to show why viewers may actually be familiar with the works.
