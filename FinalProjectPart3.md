### Final Data Story 

#### Intended Audience
The intended audience for this story is people who have never really explored or seen an opera. BEcause I talk about industyr statistics as a whole, they are not stuck in any particular geographic region. I wanted this to be as broad as possible, which made getting specific data a bit difficult in the beginning. With this audience in mind, I aimed to avoid jargon and use language that an audience unfamiliar with opera would understand. I also tried to pick visuals that would be exciting and interesting for people who may otherwise not care about the art form. 

Because of my personal interests in opera and the arts, it was difficult to find people to interview who mimicked my target audience. However, I got a lot of valuable feedback from in-class critique. Orginally I had a visualization showing the names of different operas as the "hook" of my presentation. My classmates said that it just looked like a bunch of names and really didn't tell them anything about the art form. That was very helpful. To address this, I made that visualization less prominent and added a bit more narrative explanation to show why viewers may actually be familiar with the works. 

#### Design Decisions and What I've Learned

One of the hardest decisions with this project was identifying a story that had data to support it. I also wanted to be able to visualize data in more than one way (ie - not a not of pie charts). A lot of the data I used in the final project was gathered from multiple sources. In some cases, like the Most Performed Operas and ALAANA Representation in training programs, I had to compile the data on my own using available resources. In the end, though, I don't feel like it hindered my final project. 

It was also a challenge for me to learn how to adapt my sketches. I often spent time trying to "perfect" my first pass. At first I was hesitant to make changes after putting in so much work. I didn't see how any other way to portray the data and was nervous that I may not be able to accomplish what my peers suggested I change. Luckily, they were very helpful with their feedback and I did not have a hard time improving my visualizations. 

One of the hardest parts of the design process was ensuring all the visuals looked similar. I was very happy with my devised color scheme - I picked dark colors that would be reminiscent of the inside of a theater space (red of the curtain, blue of the seats, black and tan of the stage). Once that was set, though, I realized I would need to use different platforms to create graphs. I ultimately used Tableau, Infogram, and Datawrapper to complete the final project.
