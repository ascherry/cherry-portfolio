# From the Stage - Data and the Future of Opera 

### Opera America: The Data Gatherers of Opera 

Anyone who knows me knows that I adore opera. I often cry when the curtain goes up, listen to opera on Spotify, and currently intern for an opera company. While it is a relatively small field, there is an overarching organization that helps organize opera companies and opera personnel across the world - Opera America. Their main goal is to support the creators, singers, and personnel who make opera possible. One way they fulfill this mission is through data collection and publishing reports.

### The Original Data Visualization

Each year, Opera America publishes an Annual Field report, intended to give a holistic view of the state of the industry. For this assignment, I used data from the Annual Field Report: FY 2017. In early January 2020, they did publish the next iteration of this report. However, I am more familiar with the FY17 data, and I think it needed work. 

The full FY17 report can be found [here.](https://www.operaamerica.org/files/oadocs/financials/FY17_AFR.pdf) In addition to the visualization, this document from Opera America also contains all the necessary data for the redesign.  I chose to focus on the chart at the bottom of page 5 titled "Percent of Total Operating Revenue." I've inserted a screenshot below.

This specific chart refers to data regarding Budget 1 opera companies. Because there are so many member opera companies, Opera America divides them by "Budget Groups" to compare similarly sized organizations. Budget 1 companies include The Dallas Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Los Angeles Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Michigan Opera Theater, San Francisco Opera, the Santa Fe Opera, Seattle Opera, and Utah Symphony/Utah Opera. 

So why pick this graph? To be honest, I really didn't understand what it was trying to say. It's imperative for an opera company to know how it's getting funded. Particularly in recent years, many opera companies have been struggling financially for a number of reasons (that's a different data set). If I were an executive at a large opera company, I would need to have a complex understanding of the revenue streams that contribute to my operating budget in order to plan for the future and ensure I am running a sustainable operation. That's what I *wanted* this visualization to tell me.

### The Redesign Process

##### Critique

But that isn't what the visualization showed me. Looking at the chart above just confused me. Using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile, I critiqued the chart and learned where I wanted to improve it. Using this method, I assigned the chart low scores in usefulness, perceptibility, intuitiveness, aesthetics, and engagement. Many of those facets are interconneced. For one, the color scheme did not help me interpret the graph. On my computer screen, it was hard to distinguish the different shades of green. Different colored text on top of the labels did not help the case. I was looking for a connection between all 4 categories, and couldn't find a clear one. Earned income is very different from contributed income. The color scheme contributed to confusion regarding usefulness, perceptibiltiy, aesthetics, and engagement. I also didn't like that the stacked bar charts showed 3 non-consecutive years (2013, 2016, and 2017). I had just assumed it would show the past 3 years, so this impacted the intuitive nature of the chart. I wondered - why show only 3 years? If you are looking at trends, shouldn't you use all the data? This helped lead me to my wireframe design.

##### Wireframing 

I kept on wondering why Opera America chose to show only those 3 years, despite having data for 2013 through 2017. That helped in my wireframing approach - I wanted to somehow show the data from across all 5 years. I wasn't sure the best way to do that, so I came up with 2 ideas, shown below!

### My Solution - An Area Chart

<iframe title="% of Total Operating Revenue Static Over Time" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-5ojcY" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5ojcY/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="451"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();
</script>
