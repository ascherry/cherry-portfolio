# From the Stage - Data and the Future of Opera 

### Opera America: The Data Gatherers of Opera 

Anyone who knows me knows that I adore opera. I often cry when the curtain goes up, listen to opera on Spotify, and currently intern for an opera company. While it is a relatively small field, there is an overarching organization that helps organize opera companies and opera personnel across the world - Opera America. Their main goal is to support the creators, singers, and personnel who make opera possible. One way they fulfill this mission is through data collection and publishing reports. To learn more about Opera America, visit their website [here.](operaamerica.org)

### The Original Data Visualization

Each year, Opera America publishes an Annual Field report, intended to give a holistic view of the state of the industry. For this assignment, I used data from the Annual Field Report: FY 2017. In early January 2020, they did publish the next iteration of this report. However, I am more familiar with the FY17 data, and I think it needed work. 

The full FY17 report can be found [here.](https://www.operaamerica.org/files/oadocs/financials/FY17_AFR.pdf) In addition to the visualization, this document from Opera America also contains all the necessary data for the redesign.  I chose to focus on the chart at the bottom of page 5 titled "Percent of Total Operating Revenue." I've inserted a screenshot below.

### Critique & Wireframing



### My Solution - An Area Chart

<iframe title="% of Total Operating Revenue Static Over Time" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-5ojcY" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5ojcY/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="451"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();
</script>
