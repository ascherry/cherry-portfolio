# Looking Up in Opera 

## Part 1 - The Idea

#### Summary 

  Many times, individuals in the media as well as opera professionals profess that opera is “dying.” While audience attendance has decreased over recent years, the art form is very much alive. With more performances, new works, and new companies, the operatic field is growing. Through this project, I want to show that opera is an adaptable, living art form and get my audience excited to attend a live show. 

#### My Audience 

  The primary audience for this presentation is those who are skeptical about the future of opera. Because these people think the art form is outdated, they are less invested in the future of opera. As a reader, I want to understand how the operatic field is meeting current demands so that I feel inspired to continue supporting opera companies in the US through ticket purchases. 
  
#### Story Arc 

![StoryArc](/StoryArc.jpeg)

My story can be divided into 4 sections. 
	
**Part 1: The Current State of Opera**

>I will begin by showcasing that opera is everywhere and painting a portrait of what is being performed. To do     this, I will have a map that shows all the US opera companies as well as visualize the data of the most frequently performed operas of the last 5 years. 

>Transition:  I will state the total amount number of performances (2,200) and  attendance (2.8 million) in the 2018-2019
(https://www.operaamerica.org/files/oadocs/financials/FY18_AFR.pdf).

**Part 2: Weaknesses in the Field** 
		
>Next I will talk about one of the main concerns within opera, stagnating and declining attendance numbers. This will          illustrate why many people feel disheartened with the field. 

>Transition: We have the means to figure out why this is happening through collecting survey data (Culture Track ‘17). 

**Part 3:  Accessing Knowledge**

>Here I will show the top motivators and barriers to opera attendance. Motivators include having fun, enjoyable content, and  
new things. Barriers the idea that opera is “not for people like me.”

>Transition: With this data, opera companies are already able to make forward facing changes addressing motivators and barriers. 
	
 **Part 4:  Looking Forward**

>Using data from Americans for the Arts and the Opera America online database, I will show how opera is addressing the        motivators and barriers. Here I will focus on 

>*Having Fun* - The 2018 Americans for the Arts Survey on Public Participation shows that Americans believe the arts give “pure pleasure” and are overall positive experiences.

>*Content* - To show how this motivator works, I will state how there are 2,200 performances per year and 239 unique productions as an argument for how much content is available. https://www.operaamerica.org/files/oadocs/financials/FY18_AFR.pdf

>*New Things* - New elements include premieres (new works) as well as the creation of new American companies. Here I will show the upward trends over the past 20 years. 

>*“People like me”* - While harder to prove, I plan to show how opera is increasing their EDI initiatives through a timeline of Opera America’s EDI initiatives as well as the recent increase in diversity attendance at opera. This shows we are taking strides towards creating an environment where all people are reflected in the audience.

## Initial Sketches 

**Part 1**

These sketches are designed to show the current state of opera, focusing on locations of American Opera companies and the most frequently performed opera of the last 5 years.

![](/MostPerformedSketch.JPG)


**Part 2**

Next I will use a call out stating total opera attendance as a transition. Then I want to show that attendance numbers have stagnated and that opera accounts for a very small percentage of total live arts attendance. I am still unsure the best way to show that, since there are many categories and therefore many colors, so I experimented with a few different techniques in the sketch.

**Part 3**

In this section I'd like to show the magnitude of different motivators and barriers. 

![](/MotivatorsSketchJPG.JPG)

**Part 4**

Here I use graphs to show people are having fun at performing arts events, there are new operatic works created regularly, and the strides the field is taking to increase diversity in audiences. I will explain content with numbers of performances and productions.

## Data

The data for this project comes from many different sources. 

* Data regarding the location of American opera companies comes from the Opera America website. (
<a href="https://operaamerica.org/applications/Membership/index.aspx" target="_blank">https://operaamerica.org/applications/Membership/index.aspx.</a>). I selected only companies in the United States, because in the next chart I will show the most frequently performed operas in the US. Because this information was portrayed on a website, I saved the page as a PDF and then used Tabula to extract the data. The spreadsheet containing the data I will use in my visualization (Name, City, and State of each company) can be found  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Muk9RHpp-LW7LWqp77A2PGeyfPmHrAJ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a>

* Information regarding the most frequently performed operas comes from the Operabase website (<a href="https://www.operabase.com/statistics/en" target="_blank">https://www.operabase.com/statistics/en.</a>). Under statistics, users can set boundaries and pull queries using a variety of variables, including location and season of production. For the past 5 years, I pulled statistics of opera in each season in the US. Again, this appeared as a web page, so I saved it as a PDF and used Tabula to pull the data. I then compiled the past 5 years to create a list of top 10 performances. This spreadsheet of aggregated data can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OjIQcMDIjKH9wi-V9QA42pbSM1jeo22i/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a>

* Numbers regarding total opera attendance in the 2018/2019 Season come from Opera America’s Annual Field Report for the FY18. The report can be downloaded at <a href="https://www.operaamerica.org/files/oadocs/financials/FY18_AFR.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.operaamerica.org/files/oadocs/financials/FY18_AFR.pdf</a>. Because I intend to use this number as a callout, I did not put it into any specific spreadsheets. 

* Overall arts attendance numbers come from the Americans for the Arts Survey on Public Participation in the Arts. I will use both the 2012 and 2017 reports to pull data to graph  trends over a longer period of time. The Appendix Tables and Report for 2017 is available at 
<a href="https://www.arts.gov/publications/state-level-estimates-arts-participation-patterns-2017-2018" target="_blank">https://www.arts.gov/publications/state-level-estimates-arts-participation-patterns-2017-2018</a> and the 2012 report/data are available at <a href="https://www.arts.gov/publications/decade-arts-engagement-findings-survey-public-participation-arts-2002-2012" target="_blank">https://www.arts.gov/publications/decade-arts-engagement-findings-survey-public-participation-arts-2002-2012</a>. Again, I compiled the most pertinent data into an excel spreadsheet, which is accessible <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e_POUem3f9vFX4clKzYeaJPQBEge1XkS/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a>. 

* Data regarding the top motivators and barriers to the arts is compiled by LaPlaca Cohen and published in the Culture Track ‘17 report. The report along with supporting and raw data is available on their website at  (<a href="https://culturetrack.com/research/reports/" target="_blank">https://culturetrack.com/research/reports/</a>). I will use this data to highlight the reasons why opera attendance is declining and show how the field is working to motivate and engage attendance. 

* Data regarding public opinion on the arts was collected through an Americans for the Arts poll in 2018. This data indicates that people do enjoy and “have fun” at arts events, which plays into the top motivator of opera attendance. This data is available online a t<a href="https://www.operaamerica.org" target="_blank">https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/reports-and-data/research-studies-publications/public-opinion-poll.</a> 

* To show how much opera content is available, I will show the numbers of total performances and productions in the 2018-2019 season, which comes from Opera America’s Annual Field Report for the FY18. The report can be downloaded at <a href="https://www.operaamerica.org/files/oadocs/financials/FY18_AFR.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.operaamerica.org/files/oadocs/financials/FY18_AFR.pdf</a>. This will be explained more than charted, so I did not move it into an excel sheet. 

* To get data regarding the number of premieres and new opera companies created over the past 2 decades, I compiled a spreadsheet using information for Opera America’s North American works database (
<a href="https://www.operaamerica.org/applications/NorthAmerican/timeLine.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.operaamerica.org/applications/NorthAmerican/timeLine.aspx</a>). I clicked through the different screens to transfer the data and compiled it in a spreadsheet <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WVFvE8E1hBP9Sofu1fJUDNgBhrHUvaum/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a> I will use this data to support the amount of “new things” in the opera field, which is another motivator.

* To create a timeline, I will use information from an article discussing Opera America’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion initiatives (<a href="https://medium.com/@OPERAAmerica/a-place-of-learning-7ca5dab93840" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@OPERAAmerica/a-place-of-learning-7ca5dab93840.</a>). This will allow me to tell a story of the steps being taken to promote diversity within opera and create an environment where all audiences feel welcomed. 

* There are more diverse opera audiences today than ever before. This data comes from the Opera America quick facts sheet, accessible at 
<a href="https://operaamerica.org/content/about/PressRoom/quick.aspx" target="_blank">https://operaamerica.org/content/about/PressRoom/quick.aspx.</a> Again, this emphasis on showing increases in diversity helps audiences to see that opera can be for them, which addresses one of the largest barriers for opera attendance. 

## Method and Medium 

The main presentation method for this project will be on Shortand.  
<a href="https://shorthand.com/" target="_blank">Shorthand.</a> This will allow me to integrate charts, pictures, and text into my project. While I have not worked with Shorthand in the pass, I am familiar with other platforms like Wordpress and SquareSpace and confident I will learn how to use Shorthand effectively. 

As previously mentioned, I am using other tools to help create my project. I have already used <a href="https://tabula.technology/" target="_blank">Tabula</a> to pull data from PDFs. I plan to create my visuals using <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank">DataWrapper</a>, <a href="https://rawgraphs.io/" target="_blank">RAWGraphs</a>, <a href="https://infogram.com/" target="_blank">Infogram</a>, and work with <a href="https://www.zeemaps.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiA-P7xBRAvEiwAow-VaQ6ODqDOwFizKfb-Ik_hCH9X3Kl1232ILewuqI56xZ63EgIulqzpbRoCQ6EQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">ZeeMaps</a> to create an interactive map showing the locations of all American opera companies. 

## Part 2 - Design/User Feeback

#### Storyboard & Sketches

Using my outline from [Part 1](/FinalProject_Cherry.md), I created a storyboard using <a href="https://balsamiq.com" target="_blank">Balsamiq.</a> I chose the webpage layout because my Final Deliverable will be a Shorthand website. The storyboard is intended to mimic how a user will scroll through the Shorthand page. Below my storyboard are more detailed sketches of each of the graphs I intend to include in the final presentation. I already made a few changes based on in-class discussion. My critique group did not understand why I included information early on regarding the names of operas. I decided to move this graphic later to my discussion of operatic content. In class, I also realized that the initial chart I created did not tell a relevant story on diversity in opera, so I changed my approach and decided to focus on diversity in Young Professional singer programs.

#### User Research Protocol  

Target Audience: Culture enthusiasts who are unfamiliar with opera. 

For the sake of these interviews, it is hard to identify this exact audience due to personal bias. Because I am highly involved in the operatic world, many of my friends and acquaintances are familiar with opera. I recognize this as a potential flaw in gathering user feedback, but with the constraints of the class it is necessary to move forward with interview data I do have. 

In choosing interviewees, I selected individuals who I know to have limited exposure to opera. They do not work in the field and have only attended a handful, if any, live performances. I do know, however, they participate in other cultural activities like visiting museums and historic sites and going to classical or jazz concerts.

In talking with my classmates I realized that the story I thought my charts told was different from the story my audience understood. Because of that, my interview questions are designed to determine what my potential audiences key takeaways are as well establishing prior knowledge of opera and any areas of confusion. 

Interview Questions: 
1. What are 3 words or phrases you associate with opera?
2. Have you ever attended a live opera performance? 
3. After reviewing the storyboard and sketches, what is your key takeaway?
4. What, if anything, did you find confusing about the sketches?
5. What element or sketch did you find most interesting and why?
6. What additional information would you like to have? 
7. Do you think your views towards opera have changed? Why or why not? 

<details><summary>Interview #1</summary><br>

Male, 23, never seen a live opera performance

In my first interview, the participant is close to my target audience. They have never seen a live performance, and associate more obvious words like "singing" and "music" with the field. Their key takeaway was that the Great Recession negatively impacted arts attendance, but the field is now coming back. I found this interesting because I had not thought to even include information regarding the Great Recession in my chart, but it could be helpful in explaining why attendance numbers dipped. The subject was a bit confused by the circle arrangement in my "Motivator" chart. I will make sure that the elements are all easily readable. The most interesting element was "the more diverse the performance is, the more diverse the audience will be which opens up more opportunity for interest in opera." This is helpful in addressing barriers. Im regards to more information, this participant expressed interesting in learning how the average age range for opera audiences differs from other performing arts as well as the average ticket price. 

Overall, the sketches were effective because "now that I've learned more about operas, I'm more willing to go to one."

</details>

<details><summary>Interview #2</summary><br>

Female, 22, seen 2 live operas

This participant listed "not in english," "dressing up," and "grandparents" as 3 words related to opera. They mentioned they had seen 2 operas while abroad and "understood very little of it." This helps fit my target audience because the participant is unfamiliar with the American opera scene. Their overall takeaway was that "opera companies/communities are making an effort to connect with today's potential audiences, though there are many barriers from people's preconceptions of the art form." This helps achieve my goal because it shows that audiences can see the change within the industry, something I am trying to illustrate with these charts. The participant found some explanations a bit confusing. They did not quite understand what Opera America is and expressed confusion over whether diversity numbers related to audiences or performers. I can clarify these points with my written explanations. This person also found the diversity barrier to be the most interesting. This will help inform my personas because younger people tend to be more interested in equity issues. For additional information, they suggested talking about addressing more barriers. While there is limited hard data to show how how the field as a whole addresses other barriers (cost, language, etc) I can explain certain case studies through anecdotes to help tell the story. 

Again, this participant said the data changed their view on opera. Specifically, they were "surprised at the proportion of singers of color to white singers in the companies you've listed. Love seeing that."

</details>

<details><summary>Interview #3</summary><br>

Male, 55, some exposure to opera (unspecified)

The participant associated the words "cultural," "inspirational," and "international" with opera. Their key takeway was that, despite confirmation that attendance is declining in fine arts performance, "here is hope that that this will stabilize and improve." this participant was confused about how the most frequently performed operas address a barrier or motivator. I can clarify that with the title of the chart. Additionally, they were confused on whether this data was for opera around the world or just in the United States. I understand where this confusion stems from, as the participant listed "international" as an element they associate with opera. Again, this is something I can clarify in my introduction. They found the motivators for attendance most interesting. For additional information, this participant wanted to know more about what was driving overall increase in performing arts attendance, since I only showed declining and stagnating attendance. This information can potentially be added to a line chart. They also asked more about funding. I am seeing ticket prices and money as a recurring theme, which suggests I should show that data in my presentation. This interviewee also asked if there were any opera companies going against the trend with increasing attenance or revenue, and why. 

This participant stated that the storyboard and sketches "makes me want to go see another contemporary opera."

</details>

<details><summary>Interview #4</summary><br>
 
 Female, 55, seen 1 live opera 

This participant associated the words "music," "set," and "story" with opera. Their key takeaway was that 
"Far from being a dying art form, the opera movement can take advantage of people’s interest in the arts to grow.  It seems like there is huge potential growth." In general, they had difficulty figuring out was was being compared in the sketches. This means I need to ensure the labels and titles are accurate and succinct. Like in a previous interview, they mentioned the most interesting element was the part on diversity. "I believe it is quite insightful to focus on this aspect.  I’ve felt this way myself, so I can attest that many people feel this way. Often it appears that the focus is on what those in the arts perceive as barriers (funding, accessibility, publicity, etc.) when the main barrier might be this personal connection, or lack of connection." This persone wanted additional suggestions for opera recordings or additional resources, particularly in regards to contemporary opera. This may indicate that my call to action should be adjusted to reflect further investigation into opera in any way, not just through ticket purchases, because that may not be possible for all potential users. 

When asked about a changing viewpoint, this person said "I do believe my views have changed.  The idea that opera is not just symphonic, and that there are so many vital elements involved, is huge for me.  I need to portray contemporary opera in a more positive light, focusing on story, set and costume as well as the classical music piece when I discuss opera."

</details>

##### Overall Findings

There were some recurring themes across all interview regarding money and ticket prices. I will try to incorporate this information when talking about the current state and success of different opera companies. Because I chose to work with the field as a whole, it is difficult to find data regarding ticket prices which accurately represents the whole field because companies of different sizes inherently have different ticketing models. I will attempt to explain this and use small callouts/infographics to explain a few ticket prices in different areas. I will also identify specific examples to showcase some of the trends that are harder to discuss on an industry-wide basis, such as specific initiatives to address barriers like finding someone to go with and inconvenience. Many individual opera companies have their own initiatives.

## Final Deliverable

### Part 3 - Final Data Story 

#### Intended Audience
The intended audience for this story is people who have never really explored or seen an opera. BEcause I talk about industyr statistics as a whole, they are not stuck in any particular geographic region. I wanted this to be as broad as possible, which made getting specific data a bit difficult in the beginning. With this audience in mind, I aimed to avoid jargon and use language that an audience unfamiliar with opera would understand. I also tried to pick visuals that would be exciting and interesting for people who may otherwise not care about the art form. 

Because of my personal interests in opera and the arts, it was difficult to find people to interview who mimicked my target audience. However, I got a lot of valuable feedback from in-class critique. Orginally I had a visualization showing the names of different operas as the "hook" of my presentation. My classmates said that it just looked like a bunch of names and really didn't tell them anything about the art form. That was very helpful. To address this, I made that visualization less prominent and added a bit more narrative explanation to show why viewers may actually be familiar with the works. 

#### Design Decisions and What I've Learned

One of the hardest decisions with this project was identifying a story that had data to support it. I also wanted to be able to visualize data in more than one way (ie - not a not of pie charts). A lot of the data I used in the final project was gathered from multiple sources. In some cases, like the Most Performed Operas and ALAANA Representation in training programs, I had to compile the data on my own using available resources. In the end, though, I don't feel like it hindered my final project. 

It was also a challenge for me to learn how to adapt my sketches. I often spent time trying to "perfect" my first pass. At first I was hesitant to make changes after putting in so much work. I didn't see how any other way to portray the data and was nervous that I may not be able to accomplish what my peers suggested I change. Luckily, they were very helpful with their feedback and I did not have a hard time improving my visualizations. 

One of the hardest parts of the design process was ensuring all the visuals looked similar. I was very happy with my devised color scheme - I picked dark colors that would be reminiscent of the inside of a theater space (red of the curtain, blue of the seats, black and tan of the stage). Once that was set, though, I realized I would need to use different platforms to create graphs. I ultimately used Tableau, Infogram, and Datawrapper to complete the final project.
