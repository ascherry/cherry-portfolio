# Opera is Moving Up 

## Project Outline

#### Summary 

Many times, individuals in the media as well as opera professionals profess that opera is “dying.” While audience attendance has decreased over recent years, the art form is very much alive. With more performances, new works, and new companies, the operatic field is growing. Through this project, I want to show that opera is an adaptable, living art form and get my audience excited to attend a live show.
