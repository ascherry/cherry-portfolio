# Looking Up in Opera 

## Project Outline

#### Summary 

  Many times, individuals in the media as well as opera professionals profess that opera is “dying.” While audience attendance has decreased over recent years, the art form is very much alive. With more performances, new works, and new companies, the operatic field is growing. Through this project, I want to show that opera is an adaptable, living art form and get my audience excited to attend a live show. 

#### My Audience 

  The primary audience for this presentation is those who are skeptical about the future of opera. Because these people think the art form is outdated, they are less invested in the future of opera. As a reader, I want to understand how the operatic field is meeting current demands so that I feel inspired to continue supporting opera companies in the US through ticket purchases. 
  
#### Story Arc 

![StoryArc](/StoryArc.jpeg)

My story can be divided into 4 sections. 
	
**Part 1: The Current State of Opera**

>I will begin by showcasing that opera is everywhere and painting a portrait of what is being performed. To do     this, I will have a map that shows all the US opera companies as well as visualize the data of the most frequently performed operas of the last 5 years. 

>Transition:  I will state the total amount number of performances (2,200) and  attendance (2.8 million) in the 2018-2019
(https://www.operaamerica.org/files/oadocs/financials/FY18_AFR.pdf).

**Part 2: Weaknesses in the Field** 
		
>Next I will talk about one of the main concerns within opera, stagnating and declining attendance numbers. This will          illustrate why many people feel disheartened with the field. 

>Transition: We have the means to figure out why this is happening through collecting survey data (Culture Track ‘17). 

**Part 3:  Accessing Knowledge**

>Here I will show the top motivators and barriers to opera attendance. Motivators include having fun, enjoyable content, and  
new things. Barriers the idea that opera is “not for people like me.”

>Transition: With this data, opera companies are already able to make forward facing changes addressing motivators and barriers. 
	
 **Part 4:  Looking Forward**

>Using data from Americans for the Arts and the Opera America online database, I will show how opera is addressing the        motivators and barriers. Here I will focus on 

>*Having Fun* - The 2018 Americans for the Arts Survey on Public Participation shows that Americans believe the arts give “pure pleasure” and are overall positive experiences.

>*Content* - To show how this motivator works, I will state how there are 2,200 performances per year and 239 unique productions as an argument for how much content is available. https://www.operaamerica.org/files/oadocs/financials/FY18_AFR.pdf

>*New Things* - New elements include premieres (new works) as well as the creation of new American companies. Here I will show the upward trends over the past 20 years. 

>*“People like me”* - While harder to prove, I plan to show how opera is increasing their EDI initiatives through a timeline of Opera America’s EDI initiatives as well as the recent increase in diversity attendance at opera. This shows we are taking strides towards creating an environment where all people are reflected in the audience.
