# Final Project Part 2 - Storyboard, Feedback, Wireframes, and Personas

#### Storyboard & Sketches

Using my outline from [Part 1](/FinalProject_Cherry.md), I created a storyboard using <a href="https://balsamiq.com" target="_blank">Balsamiq.</a> I chose the webpage layout because my Final Deliverable will be a Shorthand website. The storyboard is intended to mimic how a user will scroll through the Shorthand page. Below my storyboard are more detailed sketches of each of the graphs I intend to include in the final presentation. I already made a few changes based on in-class discussion. My critique group did not understand why I included information early on regarding the names of operas. I decided to move this graphic later to my discussion of operatic content. In class, I also realized that the initial chart I created did not tell a relevant story on diversity in opera, so I changed my approach and decided to focus on diversity in Young Professional singer programs.

#### User Research Protocol  

Target Audience: Culture enthusiasts who are unfamiliar with opera. 

For the sake of these interviews, it is hard to identify this exact audience due to personal bias. Because I am highly involved in the operatic world, many of my friends and acquaintances are familiar with opera. I recognize this as a potential flaw in gathering user feedback, but with the constraints of the class it is necessary to move forward with interview data I do have. 

In choosing interviewees, I selected individuals who I know to have limited exposure to opera. They do not work in the field and have only attended a handful, if any, live performances. I do know, however, they participate in other cultural activities like visiting museums and historic sites and going to classical or jazz concerts.

In talking with my classmates I realized that the story I thought my charts told was different from the story my audience understood. Because of that, my interview questions are designed to determine what my potential audiences key takeaways are as well establishing prior knowledge of opera and any areas of confusion. 

Interview Questions: 
1. What are 3 words or phrases you associate with opera?
2. Have you ever attended a live opera performance? 
3. After reviewing the storyboard and sketches, what is your key takeaway?
4. What, if anything, did you find confusing about the sketches?
5. What element or sketch did you find most interesting and why?
6. What additional information would you like to have? 
7. Do you think your views towards opera have changed? Why or why not?
