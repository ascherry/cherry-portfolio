# Final Project Part 2 - Storyboard, Feedback, Wireframes, and Personas

#### Storyboard & Sketches

Using my outline from [Part 1](/FinalProject_Cherry.md), I created a storyboard using <a href="https://balsamiq.com" target="_blank">Balsamiq.</a> I chose the webpage layout because my Final Deliverable will be a Shorthand website. The storyboard is intended to mimic how a user will scroll through the Shorthand page. Below my storyboard are more detailed sketches of each of the graphs I intend to include in the final presentation. I already made a few changes based on in-class discussion. My critique group did not understand why I included information early on regarding the names of operas. I decided to move this graphic later to my discussion of operatic content. In class, I also realized that the initial chart I created did not tell a relevant story on diversity in opera, so I changed my approach and decided to focus on diversity in Young Professional singer programs.
