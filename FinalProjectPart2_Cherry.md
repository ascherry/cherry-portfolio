# Final Project Part 2 - Storyboard, Feedback, Wireframes, and Personas

#### Storyboard & Sketches

Using my outline from [Part 1](/FinalProject_Cherry.md), I created a storyboard using <a href="https://balsamiq.com" target="_blank">Balsamiq.</a> I chose the webpage layout because my Final Deliverable will be a Shorthand website. The storyboard is intended to mimic how a user will scroll through the Shorthand page. Below my storyboard are more detailed sketches of each of the graphs I intend to include in the final presentation. I already made a few changes based on in-class discussion. My critique group did not understand why I included information early on regarding the names of operas. I decided to move this graphic later to my discussion of operatic content. In class, I also realized that the initial chart I created did not tell a relevant story on diversity in opera, so I changed my approach and decided to focus on diversity in Young Professional singer programs.

#### User Research Protocol  

Target Audience: Culture enthusiasts who are unfamiliar with opera. 

For the sake of these interviews, it is hard to identify this exact audience due to personal bias. Because I am highly involved in the operatic world, many of my friends and acquaintances are familiar with opera. I recognize this as a potential flaw in gathering user feedback, but with the constraints of the class it is necessary to move forward with interview data I do have. 

In choosing interviewees, I selected individuals who I know to have limited exposure to opera. They do not work in the field and have only attended a handful, if any, live performances. I do know, however, they participate in other cultural activities like visiting museums and historic sites and going to classical or jazz concerts.

In talking with my classmates I realized that the story I thought my charts told was different from the story my audience understood. Because of that, my interview questions are designed to determine what my potential audiences key takeaways are as well establishing prior knowledge of opera and any areas of confusion. 

Interview Questions: 
1. What are 3 words or phrases you associate with opera?
2. Have you ever attended a live opera performance? 
3. After reviewing the storyboard and sketches, what is your key takeaway?
4. What, if anything, did you find confusing about the sketches?
5. What element or sketch did you find most interesting and why?
6. What additional information would you like to have? 
7. Do you think your views towards opera have changed? Why or why not? 

<details><summary>Interview #1</summary><br>

Male, 23, never seen a live opera performance

In my first interview, the participant is close to my target audience. They have never seen a live performance, and associate more obvious words like "singing" and "music" with the field. Their key takeaway was that the Great Recession negatively impacted arts attendance, but the field is now coming back. I found this interesting because I had not thought to even include information regarding the Great Recession in my chart, but it could be helpful in explaining why attendance numbers dipped. The subject was a bit confused by the circle arrangement in my "Motivator" chart. I will make sure that the elements are all easily readable. The most interesting element was "the more diverse the performance is, the more diverse the audience will be which opens up more opportunity for interest in opera." This is helpful in addressing barriers. Im regards to more information, this participant expressed interesting in learning how the average age range for opera audiences differs from other performing arts as well as the average ticket price. 

Overall, the sketches were effective because "now that I've learned more about operas, I'm more willing to go to one."

<details><summary>Interview #2</summary><br>

Female, 22, seen 2 live operas

This participant listed "not in english," "dressing up," and "grandparents" as 3 words related to opera. They mentioned they had seen 2 operas while abroad and "understood very little of it." This helps fit my target audience because the participant is unfamiliar with the American opera scene. Their overall takeaway was that "opera companies/communities are making an effort to connect with today's potential audiences, though there are many barriers from people's preconceptions of the art form." This helps achieve my goal because it shows that audiences can see the change within the industry, something I am trying to illustrate with these charts. The participant found some explanations a bit confusing. They did not quite understand what Opera America is and expressed confusion over whether diversity numbers related to audiences or performers. I can clarify these points with my written explanations. This person also found the diversity barrier to be the most interesting. This will help inform my personas because younger people tend to be more interested in equity issues. For additional information, they suggested talking about addressing more barriers. While there is limited hard data to show how how the field as a whole addresses other barriers (cost, language, etc) I can explain certain case studies through anecdotes to help tell the story. 

Again, this participant said the data changed their view on opera. Specifically, they were "surprised at the proportion of singers of color to white singers in the companies you've listed. Love seeing that."

<details><summary>Interview #3</summary><br>

Male, 55, some exposure to opera (unspecified)

The participant associated the words "cultural," "inspirational," and "international" with opera. Their key takeway was that, despite confirmation that attendance is declining in fine arts performance, "here is hope that that this will stabilize and improve." this participant was confused about how the most frequently performed operas address a barrier or motivator. I can clarify that with the title of the chart. Additionally, they were confused on whether this data was for opera around the world or just in the United States. I understand where this confusion stems from, as the participant listed "international" as an element they associate with opera. Again, this is something I can clarify in my introduction. They found the motivators for attendance most interesting. For additional information, this participant wanted to know more about what was driving overall increase in performing arts attendance, since I only showed declining and stagnating attendance. This information can potentially be added to a line chart. They also asked more about funding. I am seeing ticket prices and money as a recurring theme, which suggests I should show that data in my presentation. This interviewee also asked if there were any opera companies going against the trend with increasing attenance or revenue, and why. 

This participant stated that the storyboard and sketches "makes me want to go see another contemporary opera."

<details><summary>Interview #4</summary><br>
 
 Female, 55, seen 1 live opera 

This participant associated the words "music," "set," and "story" with opera. Their key takeaway was that 
"Far from being a dying art form, the opera movement can take advantage of people’s interest in the arts to grow.  It seems like there is huge potential growth." In general, they had difficulty figuring out was was being compared in the sketches. This means I need to ensure the labels and titles are accurate and succinct. Like in a previous interview, they mentioned the most interesting element was the part on diversity. "I believe it is quite insightful to focus on this aspect.  I’ve felt this way myself, so I can attest that many people feel this way. Often it appears that the focus is on what those in the arts perceive as barriers (funding, accessibility, publicity, etc.) when the main barrier might be this personal connection, or lack of connection." This persone wanted additional suggestions for opera recordings or additional resources, particularly in regards to contemporary opera. This may indicate that my call to action should be adjusted to reflect further investigation into opera in any way, not just through ticket purchases, because that may not be possible for all potential users. 

When asked about a changing viewpoint, this person said "I do believe my views have changed.  The idea that opera is not just symphonic, and that there are so many vital elements involved, is huge for me.  I need to portray contemporary opera in a more positive light, focusing on story, set and costume as well as the classical music piece when I discuss opera."

##### Overall Findings

There were some recurring themes across all interview regarding money and ticket prices. I will try to incorporate this information when talking about the current state and success of different opera companies. I will also identify specific examples to showcase some of the trends.
